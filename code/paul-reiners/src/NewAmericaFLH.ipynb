Do the variable codes and labels remain consistent across ACS versions? For example, does DP_002E in 2014 and DP_002E in 2019 refer to the same information? (Note that you can attempt this task using any county's ACS datasets - we know for certain that (e.g.) 2014 Hillsborough County and 2014 Miami-Dade County variables are consistent with each other.)"
